# ETL Projects in Python
<p>This Project is part of "Python Project for Data Engineering" Course in Coursera. The aim of this project is to perform a simple ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process in Python.</p>
In this project I extract a dataset called "bank_market_cap_1.json". This dataset has two attributes which are: 'Name' and 'Market Cap (US$ Billion)'.
Then, I will transform the value of the market cap from USD to GBP. In order to that, I use a dataset called "exchange_rates" to define the exchange rate from USD to GBP.
After that, I load the transformed data into a csv file called "bank_market_cap_gbp.csv".
I do this project in Jupyter Notebook from IBM's Skills Network Labs.
Feel free to study the ETL process from this project.
