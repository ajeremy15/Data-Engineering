# ETL Projects in Python
This Project is part of "Python Project for Data Engineering" Course in Coursera. The aim of this project is to perform a simple ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process in Python.\n
In this project I extract a dataset called "bank_market_cap_1.json". This dataset has two attributes which are: 'Name' and 'Market Cap (US$ Billion)'.\n
Then, I will transform the value of the market cap from USD to GBP. In order to that, I use a dataset called "exchange_rates" to define the exchange rate from USD to GBP.\n
After that, I load the transformed data into a csv file called "bank_market_cap_gbp.csv".\n
I do this project in Jupyter Notebook from IBM's Skills Network Labs.\n
Feel free to study the ETL process from this project.\n
